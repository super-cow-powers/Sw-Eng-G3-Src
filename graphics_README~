What's an ExtShape?
An extshape is an OpenJFX Group, containing a StackPane as the immediate child, which then contains a Shape and a VBox containing any text in a TextFlow.

How do I get one?
Create an ExtShapeFactory and call makeShape on it, specifying your required shape type.
The Factory will create ExtShapes with default callback handlers - call the appropriate Factory method to set these.
    Callback Handlers: These should be a standard Java Consumer - any old Lambda will do.

Properties:
ExtShapes use StrokeProperties to - get this - define their stroke properties (setStroke), and  VisualProperties to set their shadow, fill, and if the shape is visible.
FontProps are used to style text segments. 
The properties types are all a type of HashMap with a bunch of Static known properties (they could be more efficient, but I've got too much to do to care).
The public static String fields contain the XML attribute (e.g. StrokeProps.WIDTH == "width") for the associated element.
Some have a toCSS method -call it and you'll get some JFX CSS for some of the properties, but no promises it'll give CSS for everything (some don't translate well to JFX CSS).
Realistically, you shouldn't need to care about these details, just stick in the properties
