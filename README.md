# README
This is the Source for Group 3's 2021/2022 University of York Electronic Engineering Software Engineering Project.
It is a graphical Multimedia Application Development suite, programmable in a variety of Languages through bound scripts; it is somewhat simillar to a web browser's ES engine integration, where attached scripts may be executed on user interaction with elements.

## Samples
Samples of what can be built with our application may be found in `demo` and `sales_demo`.

## Building
The project requires Java 11 and OpenJFX 14 or higher, and builds with Maven. To build and run, clone this repository and then run `mvn javafx:run` which will fetch project dependancies, and then build and run the project.
